Aspiring 3D Artist with a drive to create assets and props of any size, shape or variety.  Fan of horror, so aiming to work for studios that specialise in horror games, but I am interested in working in game studios that will help me improve skills and technical knowledge to achieve the future I want. Always trying to stay proactive and on top of news related to the 3D and games industries.
