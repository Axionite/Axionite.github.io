3D Artist with a drive to create assets and props of any size, shape or variety.  Horror fan, aiming to work for studios that specialise in horror games. Also interested in working in studios that will help improve my skills and technical knowledge. Always trying to stay proactive and on top of news related to the 3D and games industries. Looking forward to being led by a studio full of great and like-minded individuals.
