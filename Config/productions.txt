Here is where my journey into 3D officially began. I learnt a range of skills and software, while recieving guidance from lecturors and fellow students. Before coming here I had an idea of what I wanted to be in the industry, a 3D character artist, which I wasn't planning on letting go but that has changed into prop and asset creation focusing on horror.
